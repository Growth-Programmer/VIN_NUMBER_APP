**VIN NUMBER AUDIO RECORDING APP**

This app was made for sound engineers and technicians who work on vehicles and needed a way to send audio recordings from an app
to their PCs or laptops to populate the recording in their audio diagnosis tools.

The app consist of a barcode scanner screen to capture and store the VIN number of the vehicle, and an audio recording screen
to capture audio data and stream it to a wave file that is stored in the devices internal storage.

Lastly, there is a saved recordings screen which shows all of the recordings that were saved, having the vin number attached to each of them.
